<p><b>Date: </b>February 16, 1999
<p><b>Subject: </b>Preliminary Draft Report on UETA Legal Treatment of
Electronic Agents
<p>
<hr><b><u>1. Introduction</u></b>
<p>This document is a revised draft <a href="#2.">(fn2)</a> of the meeting
proceedings of the Electronic Contracting Practices Working Group at the
American Bar Association’s Cyberspace Law Committee meeting in Atlanta
January 15-16, 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Working Group is focusing its efforts
on a survey of legal issues arising from the deployment of electronic agents
for business purposes, including considerations of commercial, agency,
intellectual property and tort law. As part of this survey, the Working
Groups is monitoring and commenting upon developments in UCC Articles 2,
2B and the UETA with respect to Electronic Agents. An initial rough draft
of this document was presented on January 16th to Benjamin Beard, UETA
Reporter, who has subsequently requested a more formal submission for consideration
by the UETA drafting committee in time for the upcoming February 19-21,
1999 drafting Committee meeting in Richmond, VA.
<p>This document first explores the definition currently used in the UETA
for Electronic Agent, and then examines the core operative legal rule in
the current and immediately prior draft of the UETA, along with a tentative
proposed rule developed by the Working Group at the Atlanta meeting. Next,
the extent to which operations of an electronic agent should be attributed
to a user are discussed, followed by a query about the advisability of
developing different operative rules for tool-like vs. intelligent electronic
agents (or, possibly, simply limiting application of the UETA to non-intelligent
systems). Clearly, other sections of the UETA as well as other NCCUSL draft
products also deal with use of electronic agents, however, at this time
the Working Group has limited comments to the provisions noted due to the
preliminary nature of this draft.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>2. UETA Definitions</u></b>
<p>January 29, 1999 UETA definition of electronic agent (Section 102(8)):
<p>"Electronic agent" means a computer program, electronic, or other automated
means used to initiate or respond to electronic records or performances
in whole or in part without review by an individual.
<p>Working Group commentary: The emphasis in the definition on review by
an individual may call for clarification that review occurring at any point
after completion of the record or performance does not cause a program
to fall outside this definition. Perhaps this should be clarified with
reference to an objective standard, such as: "without human review up to
and including the point at which a reasonable person would have expected
the transaction to be concluded." It has also been pointed out to the Working
Group that (absent the artificial intelligence or malfunction), the future
authorized operations of an electronic agent are in fact "reviewed" at
the time the user enters the "input" (e.g. enters: "buy 5 shares of X stock
at market value").
<p>Query whether "inputs" and/or "outputs" are a preferable term to "performances"
because any real world performances (such as shipping goods) are really
the result of computer input or output.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>3. Alternative Operative Legal Provisions</u></b>
<p><b>Prior UETA Treatment:</b> "A person who configures and enables an
electronic device is bound by operations of the device."
<p><b>Working Group Atlanta Meeting Suggestion:</b> "A person may act through
an electronic device, and the resulting operations of that device are the
acts of that person."
<p><b>Current UETA Treatment:</b> Operations of an electronic agent are
the acts of a person if the person used the electronic agent for such purposes.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>4. Attribution of an Electronic Agent's Operations to the User</u></b>
<p>The Working Group strongly supports the move in the current draft of
the UETA away from the wording that the user of an electronic agent is
"bound" by the agent, and towards a simpler attribution rule that the acts
of an agent are deemed to be the acts of the person who chose to use the
agent, subject to all of the defenses that would be available to the person
under existing substantive rules of law. Baldly legislating that a person
is to be legally "bound" by the act of an agent strongly suggests a liability
and risk allocation rule of strict liability. The scope of application
of the UETA is broad enough to raise significant concerns over such a rule.
For example, if the underlying transactions gave rise to contract or negligence
claims, then application of such a harsh rule would seem out of place because
these underlying bodies of law take into account various "escape valves"
that allow avoidance of liability under certain circumstances. For example:
<p><b>Contracts:</b> For example, there exists a contract law doctrine
that "a reasonable person would have concluded that an offer had been made"
as a condition of the right to accept.&nbsp; The user of an agent that
entered an order for 100,000 widgets when the purchaser had regularly purchased
quantities of no more than 1,000 should be able to avail herself of this
rule.
<p><b>Negligence:</b> Similarly, under tort law, the user may be able to
establish the she met a reasonable level of care which a user must take
regarding supervision of its e-agent’s actions, and beyond which the user
is exculpated
<p><b>Agency:</b> Under agency law, principals may avoid contract liability
for an agent’s acts if (i) the agent acts outside its scope of authority,
or (ii) if apparent authority is established, the agent’s act nevertheless
was of a character that prohibits reasonable reliance. Under a corollary
"escape valve" rule, principals may avoid tort liability for an agent’s
acts when the agent’s acts fall outside the scope of employment or scope
of duties (i.e. see detour and frolic doctrines).
<p>A rule that calls for a user to be "bound" by the operations of an electronic
agent fails to take account of the types of situations for which the exceptions
carved out in contract, tort and agency law have been developed. Simply
holding that the operations of an agent are to be deemed the acts of a
user leaves room for underlying fairness and exculpation rules to operate.
It may be appropriate to note the availability of these types of defenses
in commentary to the statute.
<p>The Working Group also expressed concern about the potentially confusing
terms "configures or enables," which could be read to apply to the person
that installs the agent rather than the user. The word "uses" was suggested
by the Working Group rather than "configures and enables" an electronic
agent. The current draft UETA speaks to one who "used" an electronic agent.
<p>Some members of the Working Group favored indexing attribution of an
electronic agent’s operations only to a person who engaged in use of the
electronic agent for that purpose. The concern raised was that complex
implementations may be capable of acts or operations that are non-obvious
or unpredictable by a user and which the user should not be committed.
Situations constituting intervening/superceding causes, product malfunctions
and unreasonable reliance by another party were discussed. Some members
of the Working Group, however, disagree with an intent test such as seems
to be embodied in the current draft's use of the rule: "Operations of an
electronic agent are the acts of a person if the person used the electronic
agent <b>for such purposes" </b>(emphasis added). Those members take the
view that, where an innocent party experienced some loss, the counterparty
should not have as a defense that her electronic agent acted against her
purposes. If she made the choice to use the agent, she should assume responsibility
for its acts, again subject to available defenses such as reasonable reliance.
These members would likely prefer wording proposed by the Working Group
at the Atlanta meeting (see above):
<p>The first clause of the Working Group’s tentative language (above) is
intended to make it clear that no formalistic legal barrier exists to persons
wishing to use electronic agents. The second, more substantive clause is
a simple rule of attribution deeming the acts of the agent to be the acts
of the user. The understanding underlying this approach is that the legal
consequences that would flow from those acts would and should be subject
to defenses of the type described above.&nbsp; Inclusion of the word "resulting"
was intended to link the actions which in fact set the electronic agent
in motion with the consequent operations of that agent.&nbsp; In other
words, an agent that is in fact hijacked by another person (or agent) and
which then followed that inter-meddler's bidding may not be the result
of the original User's activities. This would be an objective determination,
however, instead of the more subjective determination of the user's purposes.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<u>5. Possible Need for Different Rules For "Instruction Bound" vs. "Autonomous
Intelligent" Electronic Agents</u></h4>
Another concept not discussed by the group in Atlanta but considered by
the co-chairs is that a "one size fits all" rule for electronic agents
may not be workable. Current applications of electronic agent technology
tend to be fairly limited by their algorithms and do not attempt to "learn"
or predict their user's desires. For example, an Amazon.com program that
leads a user through the selection process and completes the sale of a
book or CD, and most automated inventory management systems, do not negotiate
prices. Agent technology already in existence and starting to be deployed,
however, is capable of more complex "autonomous" decision making skills
and, particularly when interacting with a community of other agents, so-called
"emergent behavior" can result.&nbsp; Emergent behaviors cannot be predicted
based solely on an understanding of the constituent parts of the system.&nbsp;
In such a case, particularly as between several users of agents who each
voluntarily set their agent in motion in a community of agents, it may
not be appropriate to hold a user responsible for emergent behavior of
its agent.&nbsp; This suggests that a different rule of attribution (and
perhaps substantive liability rules as well) may need to be developed to
address the unique and complicated results of emergent behavior of artificially
"intelligent" mechanisms. Especially in systems designed to accommodate
multi-agent transactional environments, group emergent behavior may require
development of legal rules that are specially tailored to those contexts
and circumstances.
<p>Whatever concepts and wording are chosen as the applicable attribution
rule for electronic agents, it would be appropriate to clarify in commentary
that the statute does not address the topic of the liability of agent developers
for defective design and "manufacture" of the agent, and is not intended
either to expand or contract the scope of such liability, if any.
<p>The Working Group is very much in the preliminary stages of its analysis,
and welcomes any input and further dialogue on these topics.
